I recently read through the portfolio for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashwin-raj-056140181/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3Bsz6NPmYJQbyesCUc9OPgWw%3D%3D" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ashwin Raj</a>, who developed an Invention Classification and Market Research Tool for <a href="https://techlaunch.arizona.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TECH Launch Arizona</a>. It’ll be a fortunate company that hires Ashwin when he completes his degree program this spring. I’m optimistic that he can find a role that aligns with his desire to make a positive impact in the world!</p> <p>Check out this and Ashwin’s other projects on his portfolio site:</p> <p>https://ashwinr136.github.io/HLT-Internship/portfolio.html</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/20250106-1.jpg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/20250106-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </body></html>
