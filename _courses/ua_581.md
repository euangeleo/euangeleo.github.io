This is the continuation of [LING/CSC/PSYC 538 _Computational Linguistics_](ua_538.md).
Students are given deeper understanding and practical experience with symbolic and analytic concepts, tools, and methods for working with natural language in computational systems. This course sequence (538-581) complements the statistical NLP course sequence (539-582).

This course will cover four main topics: modeling natural and artificial language with formal
grammars; syntactic parsing; syntactic trees and treebanks; and words & senses. Some
of these topics were introduced in LING 538, but will be explored here in greater depth.
Students will also practice using libraries and databases that are relevant for these topics.
