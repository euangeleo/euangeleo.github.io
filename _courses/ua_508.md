This course aims to prepare students for careers in computational linguistics, where some basic software engineering skills are required. When offered online, this course is not an introduction to programming, but is rather **_an introduction to software architecture and other programming concepts used in industry._**

In this course students will design and implement a project using industry best practices,
with a focus on designs that can scale up to meet the needs of a large number of potential
users. We will discuss topics such as test-driven development, object oriented programming,
databases, web scraping, and RESTful APIs. There will also be a discussion of how to
prepare for a technical job interview. By the end of the course, students will have a project
that they can show to recruiters, contacts, and potential employers, and have a plan to
prepare for getting a job in the HLT field.
