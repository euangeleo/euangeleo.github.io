This graduate-level course introduces symbolic and analytic concepts, tools, and methods for working with natural language in computational systems. This course complements the introductory statistical NLP course, [LING/CSC/INFO 539 _Statistical NLP_](/courses/ua_539).

We’ll use [the Chomsky Hierarchy](https://timhunter.humspace.ucla.edu/papers/blackwell-chomsky-hierarchy.pdf)—a hierarchy of complexity of formal languages and the formal mechanisms that are required to characterize them—as a framework to explore concepts and tools that are commonly used in symbolic computational linguistics: regular languages, as characterized by regular grammars, regular expressions, and finite-state automata; and context-free languages, as characterized by context-free grammars. This course also introduces programming that is relevant to computational linguistics in three programming languages: [Perl](https://learn.perl.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) (for definite clause grammars). We’ll apply these tools to parsing a small range of realistic language data. This will prepare students for characterizing more complex languages, and more complex approaches to parsing, in the following course, [LING 581 _Advanced Computational Linguistics_](/courss/ua_581).
