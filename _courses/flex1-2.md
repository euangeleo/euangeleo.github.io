_Facilitated by Gabriela de la Cruz Sanchez & Eric Jackson, [University of Arizona](https://linguistics.arizona.edu)_

Through eight 90-minute, hands-on sessions, participants will learn important concepts that form the foundation of dictionary-making, including issues of writing systems, part-of-speech categories, and the relationships between words and meaning. We introduce [Fieldworks Language Explorer (FLEx)](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/), an application that allows users to create a database of word and meaning information. Workshop sessions include a mix of informational sessions and practical tasks to be performed with FLEx.

By the end of this two-week workshop,
- participants will have created a language project in FLEx, with at least a few sample entries.
- participants will know how to continue entering word and meaning information into their database.
- participants will be well-prepared to continue learning how to use FLEx and to become more comfortable with its interface.

This workshop is ideal for community members who are somewhat comfortable working with computers (though you don't need to be an expert!) and who would like to begin documenting the words of their language or community, either on their own or with cooperation from other community members.
