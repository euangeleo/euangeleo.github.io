We will see how various modules of human language systems—primarily the semantic and
morphological modules—interact with syntax to affect whether a sentence is grammatical
or not, and how universal constraints control or limit a sentence’s grammaticality. Since
summer sessions of this course are primarily taken by students in the Master’s in Human
Language Technology program, our approach to building a formal grammar will emphasize
the coverage of empirical data that would be required in order to appropriately model the
full range of human linguistic competence. **Consider this course an exploration of the
range of natural language data.**
