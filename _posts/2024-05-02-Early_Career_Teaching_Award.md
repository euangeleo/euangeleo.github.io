I'm honored to receive the Early Career Teaching Award from the University of Arizona [College of Social and Behavioral Science](https://sbs.arizona.edu/). In my brief time at U of A so far, I've enjoyed the many opportunities to teach different topics and different groups of students, in different modalities. It was especially fun [to get to introduce 50+ students, mostly freshman who were probably not enthusiastic about math, to symbolic mathematical tools that allow us to represent language](https://euangeleo.github.io/courses/ua_123/).

I'm grateful for my colleagues who have helped me get off and running with many courses, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work with these great colleagues and great groups of students!
