Our _Master's in Human Language Technology_ program had one other student graduate in the fall semester: [Laura Montenegro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-montenegro-872930b2/). For her internship with [Cobalt Speech](https://www.cobaltspeech.com/), Laura evaluated a hybrid ASR model (using a Hidden Markov Model-Deep Neural Network) for [low-resource languages](https://medium.com/neuralspace/low-resource-language-what-does-it-mean-d067ec85dea5) using Cobalt's existing tools.

> Although "low-resource language" is the standard term to refer to languages without large existing datasets, I find the term "data-scarce language" to be less prone to misunderstanding; the "resource" that is low is _prepared datasets_, not necessarily money or people.

By definition, it's hard to find datasets for languages that are considered "low-resource," but Laura found a workable amount of audio data for the Ewe language [on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/worldboss/ewe_bible_v2_tts)â€”great practical experience for future work in NLP and speech technology!

Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors, Laura!
