This academic year, the [Human Language Technology program](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/ms-hlt) is inviting professionals in the HLT field to speak about their career experience. All of this year’s speakers are graduates of the MS in Human Language Technology program who have been working in industry for several years. We’ll hear about the speaker’s academic preparation, about the path that their career has taken since graduation, and about their view of future directions in the HLT field. These talks will end with a moderated Q&A period, where the speaker will respond to questions from those in attendance.

Our next speaker will be [Trevor Sullivan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevortds/). Trevor received a BS in Computer Science from the University of Arizona in 2016 before starting the HLT program, which he completed in 2017. Since finishing the program, he has worked at companies including ayfie and Deloitte as a Professional Services Engineer, a Full Stack Engineer, Senior Conversational AI Engineer, and is now a Principal Software Engineer with the financial services company PNC.

These talks are intended to benefit current HLT students who will be looking for HLT jobs following graduation, but are also open to other members of the department, and to people who may be interested in applying to the HLT program. In order for all of our online HLT students to be able to participate, the talks will be offered on Zoom only, and will be recorded for those who can't attend at that time. Recordings of these talks will be made available on the Linguistics Department website.
