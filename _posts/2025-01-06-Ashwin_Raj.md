With each new academic year, it's inspiring to read about the projects that the students in our *Master's in Human Language Technology* program pursue for their internship. I recently read through the portfolio for [Ashwin Raj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashwin-raj-056140181/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3Bsz6NPmYJQbyesCUc9OPgWw%3D%3D), who developed an Invention Classification and Market Research Tool for [TECH Launch Arizona](https://techlaunch.arizona.edu/). It'll be a fortunate company that hires Ashwin when he completes his degree program this spring. I'm optimistic that he can find a role that aligns with his desire to make a positive impact in the world!

Check out this and Ashwin's other projects on his portfolio site:
