Although most of the students in our _Master's in Human Language Technology_ program pursue for their internship. graduate in the spring semester, there are a few who graduate in the fall. One of those who completed the program just a few weeks ago is [Charlie Accurso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlieaccurso/). For his internship, Charlie worked as a Language and AI Engineering intern on call center software, using skills in multiple languages. Because his work will be applied by his host company in an actual project, we can't publicly share more than this!

It's one goal of our program that practical experience like this prepares students to make significant contributions to their workplace as soon as they finish the program. We wish you all the best in your future endeavors, Charlie!
