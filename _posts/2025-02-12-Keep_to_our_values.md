We need to make sure that the current push to get rid of DEI in government is not simply a stealthy way to reintroduce bias, echo chambers, and other things that will hinder us. Whether the recent infamous photo of a wall being repainted at the FBI academy was really at the FBI academy or not [https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/02/07/fbi-core-values-mural/](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/02/07/fbi-core-values-mural/), we need to maintain the values that we hold as a country, regardless of the winds of administrative change. Those values include diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as compassion, fairness, integrity, respect, and stability.

Dr. RenÃ©e Burton makes the case well in this post.
