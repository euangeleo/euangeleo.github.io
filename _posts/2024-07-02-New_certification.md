Celebrating my new certification!

I've enjoyed using [MentiMeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) to increase student engagement in classes. This certification from [MentiAcademy](https://academy.mentimeter.com/) provided some useful tools to help learners retain and be able to apply new knowledge and skills. (Don't we all wish that our teachers or trainers were better at helping us learn, rather than simply crafting the biggest information firehose that they can?)

Thank you, MentiMeter, for making this resource available!
