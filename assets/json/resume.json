      "summary": "The negation system of Yang Zhuang includes two standard negators and an aspectual negator, all of which occur before the verb; the negator meiz nearly always co-occurs with a clause-final particle nauq, which can also stand as a single-word negative response to a question. Although it is tempting to analyze nauq with a meaning beyond simply negation, this is difficult to do synchronically. Comparison with neighboring Tai languages suggests that this construction represents one stage in Jespersen's Cycle, whereby a negator is augmented with a second element, after which the second element becomes associated with negation; this element subsequently replaces the historical negator. A Jespersen's Cycle analysis also explains the occurrence of nauq as a preverbal negator in some neighboring Zhuang languages."

The Zhuang varieties surveyed in this area have been grouped into the Central branch of Taic languages. This survey of nineteen locations across the dialect area found evidence from intelligibility, from similarity of wordlists and from speaker attitudes, for assigning them to at least two distinct ISO 639-3 language codes, [zyg] “Yang Zhuang” and [zgm] “Minz Zhuang”. Language development efforts among most of the remaining one-sixth of the Zhuang population of the Dejing area would require other varieties as a basis, but for many of these varieties, Jingxi Yang could likely still be used as a means of widespread communication."

What effect do factors apart from the semantics of the verb, like semantic weight of an argument (i.e., its grammatical complexity), or information structure and discourse context, have on the realization of a predicate and its arguments? To what extent are semantic determinants of argument structure \"lexical\", and to what extent not?"

      "url": "https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3tt2m1vs",
      "summary": "This is a pilot study of the phonetic variation of vowels due to stress and syllable type in Pima, a dialect of O’odham. O’odham, along with several other Uto-Aztecan languages, has a five vowel system which appears unevenly distributed in two ways: its only front vowel is high, and it includes three high-back or high-mid vowels. This arrangement of canonical vowels appears not to reflect the influence of a drive for maximal dispersion of canonical vowels, something which has been argued to account for the frequency and type of vowel inventories cross-linguistically. Several properties of the allophonic variation observed in Pima, however, can be explained by appealing to just such a drive to maximize acoustic distinctness. Factors besides maximal distinctness must also be involved in controlling this distribution, however, as evidenced by the relative stability of this vowel system among Uto-Aztecan languages."

      "url": "http://linguistics.ucla.edu/general/dissertations/JacksonDissertationUCLA2005.pdf",
      "summary": "This dissertation examines two resultative suffixes in Pima whose properties are relevant for the hypothesis that the meanings of words in natural language have structure. The passive resultative suffix –s is canonically interpreted as a resultative proper; verbs with this suffix typically express the condition which results from an event of the type denoted by the unsuffixed verb. Certain verbs with this suffix, however, receive a derived stative interpretation, where the condition which they express need not be the result of any event at all. The possessive resultative suffix –kc, in contrast, has a more restricted distribution; verbs with this suffix receive either a resultative or derived stative interpretation, where the subject of the suffixed verb is responsible for maintaining this condition. While several analyses of the Pima resultatives are considered here, the most economical analysis of the distribution of interpretations which Pima resultatives receive involves monotonically adding semantic components in order to build the meaning of both eventive verbs and resultatives. This analysis is presented within the framework of Distributed Morphology, where the semantic components of these verbs are associated with a number of abstract syntactic elements. Since these resultatives are temporally stative, an introductory chapter explores what temporal stativity is and what it indicates about a predicate; another introductory chapter discusses published analyses of resultatives in Chichewa and German, which show several quite different ways that a morphologically and semantically derived predicate may be given this property."

One puzzling morpheme shared by Pima and Tohono O'odham is a prefix with the phonological form [s], which occurs in certain syntactic environments on many adjectives and a small set of verbs. The best generalization in Pima is that this morpheme occurs only on predicates with stative lexical aspect, but is also sensitive to polarity (ie, negation) and shows a significant number of lexical exceptions."

This paper models the behavior of the s- prefix within the non-Lexicalist framework of Distributed Morphology, treating the s- as the expression of a grammaticized semantic feature [+ STATIVE ]."
