## Interactive Sagittal Section
https://incl.pl/sammy/

This page displays a mid-sagittal section that is updated based on the articulatory features that you select using a set of radio buttons at the bottom of the page. The IPA symbol corresponding to the feature values you've selected is shown at the upper-right of the page.

## Seeing Speech
https://www.seeingspeech.ac.uk/ipa-charts/

This site displays short video clips of x-ray, MRI, and ultrasound data of a linguist producing the entire range of IPA sounds. Watch how the articulators move while the speaker produces each sound! This also provides great examples of each sound that is represented in the IPA inventory.
