Eric studied both physics and linguistics as an undergraduate at the University of Arizona and went on to graduate study in linguistics at UCLA. Since completing a [PhD in Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/ericjackson_dissertation2005/) in 2005, he has worked in southern China and Southeast Asia in community-based Applied Linguistics for [SIL Global](https://www.sil.org), an international language development NGO. [This work](https://www.sil.org/contributor/jackson-eric-m) included cooperative projects with government agencies, minority language community members, and curriculum development and teaching in a joint Masters program in Kunming.

Eric is now teaching in the [Master's in Human Language Technology](https://uazhlt.github.io/) program in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/), helping students gain the skills to develop and use computational tools for applications within natural language. Although many current natural language tools have been developed for high-resource languages like English, Eric's passion is to see these computational tools also empowering language communities that don't have huge existing datasets.
