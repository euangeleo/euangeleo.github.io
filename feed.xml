In order to start our program, however, students are required to have at least a basic proficiency in programming, preferably in Python. Many students who successfully complete our program are able to reach this required level solely through self-study, using the many high-quality, free resources that are available online. <strong>This is the advice that I typically give about this kind of preparation.</strong></p> <p>If you still need to get a foundation in basic Python, there are a number of free options available. One of our faculty has written a book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Linguists-Michael-Hammond/dp/1108737072">Python for Linguists</a>,” which you can use as a self-study reference. You can find an online, self-paced <a href="https://arizona.openclass.ai/classes/python-foundations">Introduction to Python on OpenClass.ai</a>. Alternatively, you can find a more formal (but still free and somewhat self-paced) alternative in Harvard/edX’s <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-python">Introduction to Programming with Python</a>. (The companion course, <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50X Introduction to Computer Science</a>, provides a more general introduction covering Python as well as C, HTML, Javascript, and SQL.) Once you have a basic grasp of Python, you could even pursue a slightly more advanced foundation with something like UCSD/edX’s <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/python-for-data-science-2">Python for Data Science</a>. As well as introducing important Python libraries like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_intro.asp">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp">Pandas</a>, and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-Learn</a>, this course introduces tools like <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> that are not technically restricted to Python but are often used in NLP and data science.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, you’re mainly hoping to get better prepared for other courses in NLP, you should know that the textbook for many of our courses, Speech and Language Processing, has a draft version that is available online for free at https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ . You’re not at all required to read or understand any of this prior to starting our courses, but if you have time, you could work through at least the first few chapters of this textbook to get a better understanding of foundational NLP concepts that we’ll go through in the courses in the first semester of the program.</p> <p>Whatever you end up doing in order to become more comfortable with programming, I encourage you to <em>actually just program</em>, trying to write programs that solve problems you currently face. Actually trying to use Python to solve a problem you’re familiar with will help you become more comfortable with Python. I’d also encourage you to create a free account on <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub.com</a> and begin to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> and GitHub to manage versions and improvements to your code. You can find <a href="https://gist.github.com/luismts/495d982e8c5b1a0ced4a57cf3d93cf60">guidelines for best practices with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> and GitHub here</a>.</p> <p>Once you start writing in Python, I also encourage you to <em>read through a lot of clean, model code</em>. In teaching our two introductory online courses, <a href="courses/ua_529/">LING 529</a> and <a href="courses/ua_531/">LING 531</a>, I see many students writing code that will pass the automated tests I provide—so, the code minimally does what it’s supposed to do—but it’s written in a way that is unclear to read, hard to maintain, or requires more processing work than is really needed. For Python specifically, a good source of tips for writing clean code and using Python the best way it can be used is the website <a href="http://realpython.com/">realpython.com</a>. The principles of “Clean Coding” can be found on <a href="http://cleancoder.com/">Uncle Bob’s Clean Coder</a> website and in his books, though they’re not specific to Python.</p> <p>For many of the courses in our program, we recommend setting up your development environment in Linux (such as <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">the latest Long-Term Stable version of Ubuntu</a>) or a Linux-like operating system (including macOS). If you’re accustomed to working with a Windows system, you can create a Linux environment in several ways, including creating a virtual machine with <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> or a similar tool, establishing an Ubuntu cloud desktop with a provider like Amazon Web Services, or adding Ubuntu to your computer in a single-boot or <a href="https://www.mikekasberg.com/blog/2024/05/20/dual-boot-ubuntu-24-04-and-windows-with-encryption.html">dual-boot configuration</a>. Your first HLT course will help you with this process, but becoming familiar with Ubuntu and how to use it prior to the course will help you get up to speed more quickly when that time comes. If you plan to use an Ubuntu virtual machine for your development environment, we recommend that you have a computer with at least 8 Gb of RAM.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="HLT"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you want to learn how to use language technologies to create effective tools to support languages and communities?

Your phone and tablet do not display your language. None of your devices allow you to type in your language. If you have a smart speaker, it no longer responds to your language. At best, you can record and send an audio message in your communications app of choice (whose interface is no longer in your own language), but the automatic transcription feature no longer works for your language. This was the question posed by one of the speakers at <a href="https://www.lt4all2025.eu/">the UNESCO Language Technologies for All Conference</a> that I attended last week. Sit with this for a moment and reflect on what that would feel like.</p> <p>Although digital devices work just fine for a few hundred of the world’s most populous languages, the situation this speaker asked us to imagine is the daily experience for more than a billion people, who speak one of the thousands of languages for which digital tools—even “simple” tools like keyboards, dictionaries, and spell checkers, not to mention more complex tools like large language models or automated speech recognition systems—do not yet exist.</p> <p>To be sure, for many of these people, digital devices and even access to the Internet are likely unavailable, as well. However, <strong>if our goal is to bring the positive benefits of digital platforms and communication tools to all people, then making those tools function in the languages that those people prefer is an important part of that task.</strong></p> <p>This is a complex problem. One part of the solution involves assembling corpora of digital data in these languages. This is not an easy task, and it raises questions like, <em>who should have the right to manage this kind of language data?</em> Some language communities have taken intentional action to change the trajectory of their language’s digital footprint. At this conference, the <a href="https://naijavoices.com/">NaijaVoices</a> project introduced their concept of “data farming” (an intentional contrast with “data mining”) for languages of Nigeria as an example of a community-based solution to this problem.</p> <p>The trajectory of a language’s digital footprint is also related to issues of language preservation and revitalization. At this conference, we also heard examples of the successful work that has been done by the <a href="https://estonianworld.com/technology/estonias-ai-gamble-can-four-billion-words-secure-its-languages-future/">Estonian</a> and <a href="https://www.prospect-journal.org/articles/blog-post-title-two-yjhc2-rftfm-7lsm8">Icelandic</a> language communities, to develop language technologies that aim to promote the use of these languages in digital contexts.</p> <p>There remains much work to be done, but I’m excited to be among those who are working for equitable approaches that promote the well-being of communities, regardless of the languages that they prefer to use!</p> <div style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%;"> <a href="https://www.lt4all2025.eu/" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/20250305-1.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle; text-align:center"/> </a> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="AILT"/><category term="LinkedIn"/><category term="HLT"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What if you woke up one morning, and your language could not be used on any of your devices?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Celebrating International Mother Language Day</title><link href="https://euangeleo.github.io/blog/2025/International_Mother_Language_Day/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Celebrating International Mother Language Day"/><published>2025-02-18T11:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-18T11:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://euangeleo.github.io/blog/2025/International_Mother_Language_Day</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://euangeleo.github.io/blog/2025/International_Mother_Language_Day/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eric-m-jackson_international-mother-language-day-united-activity-7297682735412690944-GNj5">See this post on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>This February 21st marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/mother-language-day">International Mother Language Day</a>. This is a good time to be reminded of what this celebration represents.</p> <p><a href="https://docs.un.org/en/A/RES/61/266">The original UN resolution</a> establishing International Mother Language Day highlights several points about language:</p> <ul> <li><strong>multilingualism</strong>—when one person speaks more than one language—is a means of promoting, protecting and preserving diversity of languages and cultures globally</li> <li>genuine multilingualism promotes unity in diversity and promotes international understanding, both of which contribute to peaceful and mutually beneficial international relationships</li> </ul> <p>Since this is a UN resolution, it’s natural that it focuses on issues at an international scale. However, issues of language and multilingualism can be found at any level of society, from the international scale, to your town, and to your own neighborhood and schools. There are people in the places where you shop, the places where you or your children study, or even the places where you worship, who speak languages that are different from yours. That should not represent a barrier to be overcome, but an opportunity for you to learn from a different way to look at the world.</p> <p>Next week, I’ll be attending <a href="https://www.lt4all2025.eu/">the UNESCO Language Technologies for All Conference</a>. Even though multilingualism can “[foster] social development by promoting inclusion, preserving cultural heritage, and empowering language communities,” language communities differ in the language technologies that are available to them, and this results in differences in how easy it is for communities to reach their goals for their members. As part of the <a href="https://ailt.arizona.edu">Advancing Indigenous Language Technologies working group</a>, I’d like to see access to appropriate language technology tools grow for <em>all</em> of the roughly 7000 languages in the world today, not just the 50 or 100 that happen to have the most data online.</p> <p>Is there something that you could do to celebrate International Mother Language Day this year? Consider starting by simply finding out about the other languages that are spoken where you live. Tucson is the traditional home to communities who speak Hiaki and O’odham, and many other languages can now be found around town. Taking the next step and trying to <strong>learn</strong> one of these languages, to paraphrase Humphrey Bogart, could be the beginning of some beautiful friendships.</p> <div style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%;"> <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/mother-language-day" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2020/01/mother-language-poster.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle; text-align:center"/> </a> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="AILT"/><category term="LinkedIn"/><category term="HLT"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's value in celebrating all languages]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Maintaining our values</title><link href="https://euangeleo.github.io/blog/2025/Keep_to_our_values/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Maintaining our values"/><published>2025-02-12T09:16:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-12T09:16:00+00:00</updated><id>https://euangeleo.github.io/blog/2025/Keep_to_our_values</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://euangeleo.github.io/blog/2025/Keep_to_our_values/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eric-m-jackson_dei-nsa-dei-activity-7295475385578704896-OwTL">See this post on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>We need to make sure that the current push to get rid of DEI in government is not simply a stealthy way to reintroduce bias, echo chambers, and other things that will hinder us.

Yes, I'm sorry, but I'm going to do it anyway because I found this essay helpful (and found it because of Gary Marcus). I like the way that this essay lays out the different kinds of "AI Skeptics" there are--and I think that these are possibly not mutually-exclusive labels, a fact which I think the author of this post, Benjamin Riley , would agree with. The labels are helpful to summarize some of the nuances of the perspectives on AI that people hold, and although some of the labels denote different nuances, some of them can be held at the same time by the same person. I found it helpful to reflect on where in this taxonomy my own perspective would land. Large language models are doing 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, and sometimes that something can be helpful, but if you don't already know enough about the problem you're asking it to solve, it can also lead you astray (as I've had to demonstrate for my freshman formal methods class many times this semester), and it does come with serious 𝘤𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘴. A worthwhile read!
