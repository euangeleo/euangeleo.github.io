# Professional academic site: Eric M. Jackson

**A personal professional website based on [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), a simple, clean, and responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics.**

## For local development using Docker

Using Docker to install Jekyll and Ruby dependencies is the easiest way.

You need to take the following steps to get `al-folio` up and running on your local machine:

- First, install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Finally, run the following command that will pull the latest pre-built image from DockerHub and will run your website.

```
$ docker compose pull
$ docker compose up
```

Note that when you run it for the first time, it will download a docker image of size 400MB or so. To see the template running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see a copy of the theme's demo website.
